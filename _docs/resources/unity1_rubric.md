# Unity Essentials Project Rubric

This rubric applies to both students who choose to create **their own Unity project** and those who follow the [Unity Essentials](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials) tutorial.

Your grade is based on **demonstrated Unity skills**, not on game genre, art quality, or project size.

---

## How This Rubric Works

- **SKILL EXPECTATIONS BY LEVEL** explains *what each score level looks like*
- **CORE UNITY SKILLS** shows *how many points each level earns*
- You must demonstrate **every core Unity skill**
- Bonus points reward advanced work but **do not replace missing skills**

## SKILL EXPECTATIONS BY LEVEL

| Unity Skill Area | 4 – Exceeds Expectations | 3 – Meets Expectations | 2 – Developing | 1 – Not Evident |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Unity Interface & Scene Setup** | Scene is clean, organized, objects renamed and grouped logically | Scene is playable with named objects | Scene exists but is cluttered or confusing | Scene incomplete or broken |
| **GameObjects & Components** | Components used correctly and intentionally across objects | Required components used correctly | Components used but misconfigured | Components missing or incorrect |
| **Player / Object Movement** | Smooth, responsive movement with boundaries or constraints | Movement works as expected | Movement works but is buggy or limited | No movement or interaction |
| **Physics & Collisions** | Rigidbody and colliders create meaningful interactions | Physics present and functional | Physics inconsistent or unreliable | No physics or collisions |
| **Game Logic & Systems** | Multiple systems work together (score, win/lose, states) | At least one working gameplay system | System partially works | No clear game logic |
| **User Interface (UI)** | Dynamic UI updates during gameplay | Static UI shows needed info | UI present but unclear or broken | No UI elements |
| **Project Organization & Playability** | Files, scenes, and scripts clearly named and structured; game feels complete | Mostly organized and playable | Disorganized or partially playable | Very disorganized or unplayable |

##  MASTERY - BONUS POINTS

Bonus points **reward advanced work** but **cannot replace missing core skills**.

| Mastery Area | Bonus Points |
|-------------|--------------|
| Advanced UI (menus, animations, dynamic bars) | +5 |
| Polished game feel (camera, feedback, transitions) | +5 |
| Audio design (layered sound effects, music) | +5 |
| Advanced systems (AI, spawning, state machines) | +5 |

**Maximum Bonus:** **+20 points**  
**Maximum Total Score:** **120 points**

## Student Expectations

Your custom Unity project must:

- Be playable from start to finish
- Include movement or interaction
- Use physics (colliders and rigidbodies)
- Demonstrate at least one gameplay system
- Include a UI element
- Be organized and clearly named

Your project does **not** have to:
- Match the tutorial
- Be a specific genre
- Have advanced art or animations
