_Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process_

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.

## Periods 1, 3, 4, & 6 - Sphero BOLT
1. List 3 sensors found on the Sphero BOLT
2. Choose one of the sensors, and write a paragraph explaining how that sensor functions.

> Note: In your paragraph, describe how the sensor you chose works and how it helps the Sphero BOLT operate. Does it measure light, speed, direction, or something else? Provide details about how the sensor gathers data and how the robot uses that information to move or react to its surroundings. Try to give an example of how this sensor might be used in a specific activity or challenge.

## 5th Period - Game Programming
Think about a video game that you enjoy playing. In a paragraph or more, describe the aspects of that game that make it enjoyable or successful. 

> Note: Consider elements like gameplay mechanics, graphics, storyline, music, and character design. Why do you think these aspects work well together, and how do they contribute to the overall experience of the game? Be as specific as possible in your analysis.

## 5th Period - App Development
Think about a mobile or web application that you use frequently. In a paragraph or more, describe the features of the app that make it useful or enjoyable to use. 

> Note: Consider elements such as the user interface (UI), design, ease of use, functionality, performance, and any unique features that set it apart. How do these aspects work together to provide a good user experience? Be specific in your analysis, and think about how these ideas could inform your own app development projects.

## 7th Period, Practicum, Independent Study and other Python Students
In a paragraph or more, reflect on your experience learning Python so far. What do you find most interesting or challenging about the language? 

> Note: Think about the basic concepts you’ve learned, such as variables, data types, or loops. How do you think these fundamentals will help you as you continue to learn more advanced programming concepts? Provide specific examples from your experience to explain your thoughts.
