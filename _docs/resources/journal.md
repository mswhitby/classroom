## 1. Journal Prompt

Language evolves rapidly, and slang plays a major role in how young people communicate. For teachers, counselors, social workers, and other professionals who work with youth, understanding slang can help build connections and improve communication. Consider the following:

- How can technology be used to help educators and service providers stay updated on evolving youth language?

- What are some potential benefits and challenges of integrating slang translation tools into educational apps, AI chatbots, or online resources?

- Should schools or youth organizations formally track and teach appropriate slang to improve communication, or is it best left informal?

- How might misunderstandings of slang impact interactions between adults and youth in schools, counseling, or mentoring programs?

Write two paragraphs exploring how technology could bridge generational language gaps while maintaining professionalism and cultural awareness.

### 1. Journal Prompt

On January 29, a tragic mid-air collision occurred over Washington, D.C., claiming the lives of 67 people, including military personnel and young athletes returning from a competition. While we mourn this loss, tragedies like this also push us to examine what went wrong and how we can prevent similar events in the future. In aviation, technology plays a crucial role in ensuring safety—yet when systems fail, the consequences can be devastating.

Technology is a key part of modern aviation, from air traffic control systems to automated flight assistance. However, even the most advanced systems can fail. Based on the recent mid-air collision over Washington, D.C., discuss how Computer Science contributes to aviation safety. Consider software development, automation, cybersecurity, or human-computer interaction. What improvements could be made to prevent accidents like this in the future?

**Possible Connections to Computer Science**

1.  **Air Traffic Control Systems** – How do computer algorithms manage airspace and prevent collisions?
2. **Automation & AI in Aviation** – The role of autopilot systems, real-time alerts, and AI-driven decision-making.
3. **Software Errors & Bugs** – How can coding flaws or miscommunication between different software systems contribute to accidents?
4. **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** – Did poor interface design or unclear alerts play a role in the crash?
5. **Cybersecurity in Aviation** – Could hacking, jamming, or cyber vulnerabilities pose risks in air traffic management?
6. **Big Data & Predictive Analytics** – How could machine learning be used to predict and prevent accidents?

Write two (2) paragraphs exploring how technology can integration can provided for increased aviation safety. You can use one or more of the six areas listed above, or you can choose another relevant topic of your interest.

The Oxford Word of the Year for 2024 is “brain rot”, a term reflecting concerns about the negative effects of excessive digital consumption on mental well-being and intellectual capacity. With so much of our time spent online, it’s easy to see why this term resonates. Platforms filled with trivial content can entertain, but they might also distract us from more meaningful pursuits.

The shortlist of runner-ups adds further layers to this theme. Words like “slop” (low-quality, often AI-generated content) and “dynamic pricing” (highlighting economic shifts influenced by technology) show the power and pitfalls of a tech-driven world. Meanwhile, terms like “romantasy” and “lore” reflect how storytelling and creativity thrive in our digital spaces, blending genres and preserving traditions. Further, words like “demure” gained prominence through viral social media posts.

The selection of these words sparks questions about how technology shapes not only our language but also our daily lives. Are we losing something valuable in the process, or are we evolving into something new?

Write a paragraph or more reflecting on the following:
- What does the term “brain rot” mean to you? Do you feel like digital media has had a positive or negative impact on your mental well-being this year?
- How do runner-up words like “slop” and “lore” connect to your experience with technology in 2024?
- In your opinion, is it possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding “brain rot”? If so, how?

Please be very “demure” and very mindful in your response. You can learn more about the the Oxford word of the year [here](https://corp.oup.com/word-of-the-year/).

_Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process_

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.
