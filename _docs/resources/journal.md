## Journal Entry - Prompt Engineering with Canva AI

AI tools like Canva AI can help people design lessons, games, and creative projects — but only if they are given clear and detailed instructions. This skill is called prompt engineering.

According to [CompTIA’s 2025 Workforce and Learning Trends report](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/resources/research/workforce-and-learning-trends-2025), AI skills are now a top workforce priority. And recent [industry research](https://www.yochana.com/2025-prompt-engineering-salary-landscape/) shows that prompt engineers today can earn between $63,000 and over $270,000 annually, depending on experience and role.  That means being good at writing prompts isn’t just creative — it can be financially worthwhile and useful in many tech-related jobs.

Today, you’ll act like a teacher or professional and create a Canva AI prompt that teaches something academic and includes interactive elements. You can check out my example [here](https://final-projectangel.my.canva.site/prompts).

## Part 1: Your Prompt

Choose a topic from any subject (science, math, history, English, or computer science).

Examples:
- “Create an interactive slide deck that explains the water cycle to 5th graders.”
- “Make a quiz that helps students practice variables in Python.”
- “Design a choose-your-own-path story about the Civil Rights Movement.”

Write a detailed Canva AI prompt that tells it exactly what to make. 

Include:
- What the topic is
- Who it’s for (younger students, classmates, etc.)
- What you want it to build (slide deck, quiz, story, poster, or game)
- How it should look or sound (fun, professional, colorful, etc.)

Generate your design in Canva AI, publish your site, and share the link in your journal.

### Part 2: Your Reflection

In 5–7 sentences, explain:
- What your prompt was designed to do
- How Canva AI understood or built your idea
- What parts worked well
- What parts didn’t come out as expected
- How you could improve your prompt to get a better design next time
- Why being good at prompt engineering could be valuable in future careers

If you were in charge of your school, what would your technology and AI policy be? Think about things like cell phones, Chromebooks, AI tools (like ChatGPT), and online games. Should games be blocked, or should certain ones (like math or learning games) be allowed? In 5–7 sentences, explain your rules and why you think they would make school better.

## Journal Entry

Students often say the phrase "6, 7" during the day, but its meaning is unclear. Your challenge is to explain this phrase in your own words. **Write exactly 67 words, spread across six or seven sentences.** Consider how students use it in class or in the halls. Think about the mood or tone when it's spoken. Be creative, but also give your best explanation of why people keep repeating it.

## Journal Entry

IKEA is experimenting with a virtual store inside Roblox, where people can actually earn $16.10 per hour to do jobs like restocking shelves, serving food, and helping customers—just like in a real store. You can read more here: [IKEA is opening a new store on Roblox… and you could be paid to work there!
](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/newsroom/corporate-news/ikea-is-opening-a-new-store-on-roblox-pub8a9272d0/).

Write a journal entry (5–7 sentences) using Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (C.E.R.) to respond to this question:

Do you think working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea or a bad idea for the future of jobs? Why?

- Claim: State your opinion clearly.
- Evidence: Use the IKEA example or your own ideas about gaming, work, or technology.
- Reasoning: Explain why your evidence supports your claim.

<!-- You may choose to complete the Beat the AI Challenge. For this option, you can use AI tools to help write your response. To receive credit, you must clearly mark at the bottom of your journal: “This response used AI.” Your challenge is to edit and improve the AI’s draft so it sounds more like you and less like a machine. -->

## Journal Entry

This year, the White House launched the Presidential AI Challenge. The goal is to find creative ways for students, teachers, and communities to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve real-world problems. The prize for winning teams is $10,000 per team member. You can learn more about the challenge here: [Presidential AI Challenge](https://www.ai.gov/initiatives/presidential-challenge).

Projects should:
- Use AI responsibly and ethically.
- Help people in education, health, safety, or the community.
- Be creative and realistic enough to try out.

### Prompt

For today’s journal, write 5–7 complete sentences using the C.E.R. format:
- Claim: State your idea for an AI project.
- Evidence: Explain how your idea meets the challenge requirements.
- Reasoning: Show why your idea would be useful and how it would help people.

If you’re interested in actually submitting an idea for the challenge, you can fill out this form: [Presidential AI Challenge - Participation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvV8FUN04EWx1Bzgj5cn3DWv-7IVqJvd6caPytAGFTNLrkew/viewform?usp=header).
