## What This Project Is About
In the real world, developers often work under short deadlines. They use **code**, **tools**, and sometimes **AI** to solve real problems efficiently. Knowing when and how to use these tools responsibly is an important real-world skill.

---

## Your Task
For this project, you will:

1. Identify a **problem or inconvenience** at school or in your community  
2. Build an **app** that helps address that problem 
3. Explain **how your app helps people**

This may be your **first app project**, and that’s okay. The goal is **progress**, not perfection.

You can work:
- **by yourself**, or
- **with a group of 1-4 members**

---

## What Counts as a “Problem”?
A problem could be anything that:
- wastes time
- causes confusion
- requires too much paper
- makes people ask the same questions over and over
- could be easier with an app

### Example Problems
- Students don’t know **where to go** for events or testing
- Teachers collect information using **paper forms**
- Clubs don’t have an easy way to **sign up members**
- People don’t know **who to contact** for help
- Information is spread across **too many places**

---

## What Your App Must Do (Minimum)

### 1. A Simple Screen Layout
- At least **3 sections on one page**  
  **OR**  
- At least **3 screens or pages**

Examples:
- Home → Form → Results  
- Home → Add Item → View List

---

### 2. User Input
Your app must let the user **do something**, such as:
- type into a form
- click buttons
- choose from a list

---

### 3. Saved Data
Your app must **remember information**.

Examples (choose one):
- save to `localStorage`
- save to a Google Sheet
- save to a JSON file

> If the app is refreshed and the data is still there, it counts.

---

### 4. A Complete “Help Loop”
Your app should follow this pattern:

> **User does something → App processes it → App shows something helpful**

Example:
- User submits a form → App saves it → App shows the updated list

---

## Using AI or "Vibe Coding"
You are encouraged to use AI to help you deliver a viable project in a short timeframe.

AI can help with:
- coming up with ideas
- writing starter code
- fixing errors
- explaining what code does
- improving text or labels

### Important Rule
For any AI code used:
- you must test the code
- you must understand what it does
- you must be able to explain it

---

## What You Turn In

### 1) Your App
- Web app link  
  **OR**  
- Video demo if it’s mobile

---

### 2) GitHub Repository
Must include:
- your code
- a short README explaining what the app does

---

### 3) 1-Page Explanation
Answer these questions:
- What problem did you solve?
- Who is this app for?
- How does it help?
- What tools did you use?
- What did you learn?

---

### 4) Short Demo Video (2–4 minutes)
Show:
- the problem
- your app working
- how it helps users

---

### 5) Reflection (Short)
Answer:
- What was the hardest part?
- What are you proud of?
- Did you use AI? If yes, how did it help?  
  If no, how could AI help in the future?

---

## Timeline (Step-by-Step)

### Jan 14–15
- choose a problem
- sketch your app
- list features

---

### Jan 16–20
- build the app
- make sure data saves
- test your app

---

### Jan 21–22
- fix bugs
- clean up the design
- write README
- record demo

---

### Jan 23
- submit everything

---

## How This Will Be Graded (Simplified)
- Does the app **work**?
- Does it **solve a real problem**?
- Can you **explain what you built**?
- Did you **try and make progress**?

---

## Final Reminder
> This is not about being perfect or advanced.  
> This is about building something real, learning how apps work, and showing effort.

## Important Notes for Students
- You **do not** need a perfect app to earn a strong grade.
- Working features + effort + explanation matter more than complexity.
- Using AI is allowed, but you must understand what your code does.
- Trying, testing, and improving your app earns credit.

> **Progress > Perfection**
