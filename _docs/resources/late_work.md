# Late Work Policy
_Effective February 5, 2025_

In accordance with the [JISD Student Handbook](https://www.judsonisd.org/departments/pupil-services/student-handbook-and-student-code-of-conduct) and the [JISD Secondary Grading Handbook](https://www.judsonisd.org/departments/curriculum-instruction/curriculum-instruction), Ms. Whitby will begin enforcing the districtâ€™s late-work policy in all of her classes. 

## Late Work Definition
Late work is defined as **any assignment that is not submitted on its due date**, except for:
- Make-up work due to absences.
- Make-up work due to approved school activities.

## Late Work Penalties
- An assignment submitted after the due date will incur a **5-point deduction for each school day** that the assignment is late, up to a **maximum penalty of 25 points**.
- Assignments will be **accepted up to 5 school days** after the due date or until **the end of the nine week grading period**, whichever comes first.
- **No assignments will be accepted after this window** unless an exception is granted.

## Make-Up Work for Absences
- Students will have **one additional day per absence** to submit work **before late penalties apply**.
- Students must communicate with me if they are unsure about deadlines or if they are in need of an extension.

## Communication Requirement
- Students **must email me** when submitting late work.
- If I am not notified, **there is no guarantee I will see or grade the work**.
- If I find late work that was submitted **without prior notification**, the **deduction will be calculated based on the day I observe the submission**, which may result in a higher penalty.

## Implementation Details
- **Grace Period:** Assignments submitted on **February 5, 2025**, will be **accepted without penalty**.
- **Penalty Commencement:** Point deductions for late submissions will **begin on February 6, 2025**.
- **Final Acceptance Date:** The **last day to submit any currently outstanding late work** is **February 12, 2025**.
