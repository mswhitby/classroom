# How to Create a GitHub Account, Repository, and Journal File

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

1. **Visit GitHub's Website:**

- Open your web browser and go to [github.com](https://github.com/).

2. **Sign Up for a New Account:**

- Click the "Sign up" button in the top right corner.
- Enter your email address, create a username, and set a password. Make sure your password is strong and easy for you to remember.
- Follow the instructions to verify your email address.

3. **Complete the Setup:**

- GitHub will ask a few more questions about your experience level and what you plan to do with GitHub. Answer these to the best of your ability, or you can skip them if you're unsure.

4. **Verify Your Account:**

- GitHub may send a verification code to your email. Check your inbox, copy the code, and enter it on the GitHub website.

5. **Explore Your GitHub Dashboard:**

- Once your account is set up, you'll be taken to your GitHub dashboard. This is where you'll manage all your projects.

## Step 2: Create a New Repository

1. **Start a New Repository:**

- On your GitHub dashboard, look for a green "New" button or the option that says "Create repository." Click it.

2. **Fill in the Repository Details:**

- **Repository Name:** Enter `WHSTechNotes` as the name for your repository.
- **Description (Optional):** You can add a brief description of your project if you'd like, but it's not required.
- **Public or Private:** Decide if you want your repository to be public (anyone can see it) or private (only you can see it). For most school projects, public is fine. If you choose to make your repository private, you'll need to add me to your repository as a collaborator. Please come speak to me so I can walk you through these steps.  
- **Initialize with a README:** Check the box that says "Add a README file." This file will be automatically created and will help others understand what your project is about.

3. **Create the Repository:**

- Click the green "Create repository" button at the bottom of the page. Your new repository is now set up!

## Step 3: Create the Journal File

1. **Add a New File:**

- In your repository, look for a button that says "Add file." Click on it, and then choose "Create new file."

2. **Name Your File:**

- In the text box that appears, type `journal.md` as the file name. The `.md` stands for Markdown, which is a simple formatting language used in GitHub.

3. **Write Your First Journal Entry:**

- **Use the Correct Date Format:** Each journal entry must start with a heading (`#`) that is the date in the following format `August 27, 2025`.
- **Example Entry:**

```markdown
# August 27, 2025

Today, I created my first GitHub account and repository. I'm excited to start using GitHub for my projects!
```

4. **Commit the File:**

- At the bottom of the page, you'll see a "Commit new file" button. This means you're saving your changes to GitHub. You can add a brief message about what you've done (like "Created journal.md"), and then click the "Commit new file" button.

5. **Check Your Repository:**

- After committing the file, you'll be taken back to your repository. You should see the `journal.md` file listed there. Click on it to view what you've written.

## Important Reminder

- **Precise Formatting Required:** It's crucial that you follow the date format and entry structure precisely, as grading will be automated. Make sure every entry begins with the correct date format as the first-level heading.

## Recap

- **GitHub Account:** Created and verified.
- **Repository:** Set up with a README file named `WHSTechNotes`.
- **journal.md:** Created with a date heading and entry for each day.

Now that your GitHub is set up, you can use it to store and track all your projects and journal entries. Happy coding!
