<!-- ## Objective:

Students will analyze viral media trends and construct a C.E.R. argument evaluating the “100 Men vs Gorilla” challenge, considering logical reasoning and ethical implications.


## TEXS

<!-- Fundamentals of CS –  -->

<!-- §126.726(c)(4)(B): “Identify, describe, and apply principles of algorithmic thinking.” Students can reason through sequences of actions the 100 people could take, testing logic against real-world constraints. --> 



## Agenda

### 1. Journal: Gorilla vs 100 Men

A challenge called “100 Men vs 1 Gorilla” went viral after a famous YouTuber suggested testing it. The idea: could 100 unarmed people defeat a silverback gorilla? Some people say yes with strategy; others say it’s impossible. Write two paragraphs considering the following:

1. Do you think the 100 people could win? Why or why not? Use logic, facts, and your own reasoning.

2. Do you think it’s responsible to make this kind of challenge go viral? What might people learn from it—or misunderstand?

3. What does this say about how trends spread online? Is there a connection between entertainment and education?

Use the C.E.R. structure:

- Claim – What do you believe?
- Evidence – What facts or logic back you up?
- Reasoning – Why does this matter?

> Dear Coach Starin,
> 
> I wanted to take a moment to thank you for everything you do to help students stay focused on work ethic, respect, and responsibility. Your expectations are clear and consistent, and even when we don’t always get it right, you still push us to do better. I’ve noticed that students in your presence tend to carry themselves with more maturity, and that’s a reflection of your leadership.
>
> Thank you for being a positive influence on our campus and for holding us to a high standard. It really does make a difference.

### 1. Journal Prompt: High School Cell Phone & Social Media Bans

Florida has enacted laws banning student cell phone use throughout the school day and restricting access to social media on school networks. Supporters argue these measures reduce distractions and cyberbullying, while opponents raise concerns about emergency communication and student autonomy. Read about Florida’s new legislation banning student cell phone use during the entire school day and restricting access to social media on school Wi-Fi:

- [What you need to know about Florida's classroom cellphone bans and a new social media law](https://www.wusf.org/politics-issues/2025-01-13/what-to-know-florida-classroom-cellphone-bans-new-social-media-law)

Write **TWO** paragraphs considering the following:

- Do you believe such bans are beneficial or detrimental to students?
- How might these policies influence student behavior, safety, and learning?
- If implemented in your school, how would you respond to such restrictions?

# April 7, 2025

## Objective

Students will be able to explain how artificial intelligence can support their learning by analyzing a real-world example of AI improving test scores in a Texas school.

## TEKS

- §126.32(c)(1)(B) - extend the learning environment beyond the school walls with digital products created to increase teaching and learning in the other subject areas
- §126.32(c)(1)(E) - create web pages using a mark-up language

## Agenda

### 1. Journal Prompt: AI & Test Prep

Write two paragraphs considering the following:

Recently, a [school in Austin, Texas used AI tutors to help students prepare for tests](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/alpha-school-two-hour-learning-ai-tutor-austin-texas)—and it worked. Their scores improved so much that they ranked in the top 2% nationally. With STAAR testing happening this week, think about how AI tools (like ChatGPT, Khanmigo, or other learning apps) could help you perform better.

How do you think AI can help you study, prepare, or stay organized for tests like the STAAR? What would be the most useful feature of an AI tutor for you personally? Be honest—do you think you’d use it? Why or why not?

As we enter the final stretch of the school year and prepare for STAAR testing, it’s normal to feel a mix of emotions—stress, excitement, pressure, even exhaustion. This week’s journal is all about checking in with you.

Write about the following:

1. How are you feeling right now—mentally, emotionally, and physically?

2. What’s been the most stressful part of school lately?

3. What are some things you do (or could do) to take care of yourself during stressful times?

4. What’s one goal you have for the rest of the school year? How will you stay motivated to reach it?

5. Who is someone you can talk to when you’re feeling overwhelmed? Why do you trust them?

You don’t have to have all the answers—just be honest. This is your space.

From the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting game outcomes to the implementation of augmented reality (AR) in broadcasting, technology is reshaping how we engage with sports. Reflect on how these technological advancements have influenced your perception of the tournament. Do you believe AI-driven predictions, such as those attempting to create perfect brackets, add excitement or detract from the unpredictability that makes March Madness thrilling? Additionally, consider the role of social media platforms and streaming services in transforming fan engagement during the tournament. How do these changes impact the traditional viewing experience and your connection to the games?”

## Agenda

### 1. Journal Prompt

Language evolves rapidly, and slang plays a major role in how young people communicate. For teachers, counselors, social workers, and other professionals who work with youth, understanding slang can help build connections and improve communication. Consider the following:

- How can technology be used to help educators and service providers stay updated on evolving youth language?

- What are some potential benefits and challenges of integrating slang translation tools into educational apps, AI chatbots, or online resources?

- Should schools or youth organizations formally track and teach appropriate slang to improve communication, or is it best left informal?

- How might misunderstandings of slang impact interactions between adults and youth in schools, counseling, or mentoring programs?

Write two paragraphs exploring how technology could bridge generational language gaps while maintaining professionalism and cultural awareness.

## Agenda

### 1. Journal 

On January 29, a tragic mid-air collision occurred over Washington, D.C., claiming the lives of 67 people, including military personnel and young athletes returning from a competition. While we mourn this loss, tragedies like this also push us to examine what went wrong and how we can prevent similar events in the future. In aviation, technology plays a crucial role in ensuring safety—yet when systems fail, the consequences can be devastating.

Technology is a key part of modern aviation, from air traffic control systems to automated flight assistance. However, even the most advanced systems can fail. Based on the recent mid-air collision over Washington, D.C., discuss how Computer Science contributes to aviation safety. Consider software development, automation, cybersecurity, or human-computer interaction. What improvements could be made to prevent accidents like this in the future?

**Possible Connections to Computer Science**

1.  **Air Traffic Control Systems** – How do computer algorithms manage airspace and prevent collisions?
2. **Automation & AI in Aviation** – The role of autopilot systems, real-time alerts, and AI-driven decision-making.
3. **Software Errors & Bugs** – How can coding flaws or miscommunication between different software systems contribute to accidents?
4. **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** – Did poor interface design or unclear alerts play a role in the crash?
5. **Cybersecurity in Aviation** – Could hacking, jamming, or cyber vulnerabilities pose risks in air traffic management?
6. **Big Data & Predictive Analytics** – How could machine learning be used to predict and prevent accidents?

Write two (2) paragraphs exploring how technology can integration can provided for increased aviation safety. You can use one or more of the six areas listed above, or you can choose another relevant topic of your interest.

## Agenda

### 1. Journal: Apprentice Mechanic Mishaps Logic Puzzle

Four apprentice mechanics work at Rusty's Repair Shop. They are generally well-regarded by management, but last week with less supervision there were some mistakes that led to a number of angry customers. Using the clues provided, can you determine which apprentice worked on which car, and the mistake that was made?

#### Clues

1. Bart didn't work on the Sierra, nor did he leave the oil cap off.
2. The four apprentices are Kayla, the one who worked on the Honda Civic, the one who left the oil cap off, and the one who left stains on the carpet.
3. The receptionist was in tears after dealing with the customer who had found a hole was accidentally drilled in their gas tank (oops!). This wasn't the Sierra.
4. Jimmy didn't leave the oil cap off nor leave stains on the carpet of the vehicle he worked on.
5. Harrison worked on the Forester, and disliked every minute of it.

#### Directions

## Agenda

### 1. Moneyball Movie

Moneyball is a compelling story about how data and technology revolutionized the way baseball teams approach player evaluation and team building. The movie follows Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, as he confronts the challenge of competing against wealthier teams with a fraction of their budget. Instead of relying on traditional methods of scouting and intuition, Beane adopts a data-driven approach introduced by Peter Brand, a young economist.

The movie highlights the importance of data science, critical thinking, and problem-solving in real-world scenarios. It demonstrates how technology, algorithms, and creative use of data can disrupt industries, foster innovation, and achieve success even with limited resources. Just as Beane used analytics to make strategic decisions, students in computer science, game programming, and app development can apply similar principles of logic and data analysis to solve complex problems in various fields.

### 2. Moneyball Questions

As we watch the movie, please answer the discussion questions posted on Canvas.

# December 9, 2024

## Agenda

### Journal Entry

The Oxford Word of the Year for 2024 is “brain rot”, a term reflecting concerns about the negative effects of excessive digital consumption on mental well-being and intellectual capacity. With so much of our time spent online, it’s easy to see why this term resonates. Platforms filled with trivial content can entertain, but they might also distract us from more meaningful pursuits.

The shortlist of runner-ups adds further layers to this theme. Words like “slop” (low-quality, often AI-generated content) and “dynamic pricing” (highlighting economic shifts influenced by technology) show the power and pitfalls of a tech-driven world. Meanwhile, terms like “romantasy” and “lore” reflect how storytelling and creativity thrive in our digital spaces, blending genres and preserving traditions. Further, words like “demure” gained prominence through viral social media posts.

The selection of these words sparks questions about how technology shapes not only our language but also our daily lives. Are we losing something valuable in the process, or are we evolving into something new?

Write a paragraph or more reflecting on the following:
- What does the term “brain rot” mean to you? Do you feel like digital media has had a positive or negative impact on your mental well-being this year?
- How do runner-up words like “slop” and “lore” connect to your experience with technology in 2024?
- In your opinion, is it possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding “brain rot”? If so, how?

Please be very “demure” and very mindful in your response. You can learn more about the the Oxford word of the year [here](https://corp.oup.com/word-of-the-year/).

Last week we looked at computer science jobs. This week we'll look at applying computer science to jobs in any industry. I'd like you to consider why is learning to code valuable regardless of the industry you choose to work in?

Write a paragraph or more focused on the following:

1. How can coding improve problem-solving skills?
2. How might understanding code help you in industries that aren’t directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education?
3. How does coding enhance creativity or collaboration?

Provide examples where coding knowledge might benefit professionals in various fields. Remember to use specific examples and reflect on how coding can impact your future career path, even if it’s not directly related to computer science.

_Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process_

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.
