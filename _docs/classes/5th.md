<summary>Writing Prompt</summary>

#### Prompt

The Super Bowl generates massive amounts of data, from player stats to real-time analytics used for coaching decisions. Many teams use **machine learning and AI** to analyze past performances and predict the best plays.

**Imagine you are a software developer working for an NFL team.** Your task is to design an application that helps coaches make better in-game decisions using real-time data. Write **TWO** paragraphs explaining your idea. If you're not sure where to start, consider the following:

1. What **features** would your application include?

2. What type of **data structures** (e.g., lists, dictionaries, databases) would you use to store player performance statistics?

3. How could **algorithms** (such as sorting, searching, or machine learning models) help analyze the data to improve decision-making?

4. If you were to visualize the data, what kind of **graphs or dashboards** would you create?

Be sure to explain your choices and how they would help a team gain a competitive advantage. You can also explore the NFL's [Next Gen Stats](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/) page to see examples how the league uses data.

## Agenda

### 1. Journal 

On January 29, a tragic mid-air collision occurred over Washington, D.C., claiming the lives of 67 people, including military personnel and young athletes returning from a competition. While we mourn this loss, tragedies like this also push us to examine what went wrong and how we can prevent similar events in the future. In aviation, technology plays a crucial role in ensuring safety—yet when systems fail, the consequences can be devastating.

Technology is a key part of modern aviation, from air traffic control systems to automated flight assistance. However, even the most advanced systems can fail. Based on the recent mid-air collision over Washington, D.C., discuss how Computer Science contributes to aviation safety. Consider software development, automation, cybersecurity, or human-computer interaction. What improvements could be made to prevent accidents like this in the future?

**Possible Connections to Computer Science**

1.  **Air Traffic Control Systems** – How do computer algorithms manage airspace and prevent collisions?
2. **Automation & AI in Aviation** – The role of autopilot systems, real-time alerts, and AI-driven decision-making.
3. **Software Errors & Bugs** – How can coding flaws or miscommunication between different software systems contribute to accidents?
4. **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** – Did poor interface design or unclear alerts play a role in the crash?
5. **Cybersecurity in Aviation** – Could hacking, jamming, or cyber vulnerabilities pose risks in air traffic management?
6. **Big Data & Predictive Analytics** – How could machine learning be used to predict and prevent accidents?

Write two (2) paragraphs exploring how technology can integration can provided for increased aviation safety. You can use one or more of the six areas listed above, or you can choose another relevant topic of your interest.

## Agenda

### 1. Journal: Apprentice Mechanic Mishaps Logic Puzzle

Four apprentice mechanics work at Rusty's Repair Shop. They are generally well-regarded by management, but last week with less supervision there were some mistakes that led to a number of angry customers. Using the clues provided, can you determine which apprentice worked on which car, and the mistake that was made?

#### Clues

1. Bart didn't work on the Sierra, nor did he leave the oil cap off.
2. The four apprentices are Kayla, the one who worked on the Honda Civic, the one who left the oil cap off, and the one who left stains on the carpet.
3. The receptionist was in tears after dealing with the customer who had found a hole was accidentally drilled in their gas tank (oops!). This wasn't the Sierra.
4. Jimmy didn't leave the oil cap off nor leave stains on the carpet of the vehicle he worked on.
5. Harrison worked on the Forester, and disliked every minute of it.

#### Directions
- Complete the puzzle, and submit the answer as a [Markdown Table](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables) in your journal
- Example:

| Name     | Car | Mistake |

## Agenda

### 1. Moneyball Movie

Moneyball is a compelling story about how data and technology revolutionized the way baseball teams approach player evaluation and team building. The movie follows Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, as he confronts the challenge of competing against wealthier teams with a fraction of their budget. Instead of relying on traditional methods of scouting and intuition, Beane adopts a data-driven approach introduced by Peter Brand, a young economist.

The movie highlights the importance of data science, critical thinking, and problem-solving in real-world scenarios. It demonstrates how technology, algorithms, and creative use of data can disrupt industries, foster innovation, and achieve success even with limited resources. Just as Beane used analytics to make strategic decisions, students in computer science, game programming, and app development can apply similar principles of logic and data analysis to solve complex problems in various fields.

### 2. Moneyball Questions

As we watch the movie, please answer the discussion questions posted on Canvas.

# December 9, 2024

## Agenda

### Journal Entry

The Oxford Word of the Year for 2024 is “brain rot”, a term reflecting concerns about the negative effects of excessive digital consumption on mental well-being and intellectual capacity. With so much of our time spent online, it’s easy to see why this term resonates. Platforms filled with trivial content can entertain, but they might also distract us from more meaningful pursuits.

The shortlist of runner-ups adds further layers to this theme. Words like “slop” (low-quality, often AI-generated content) and “dynamic pricing” (highlighting economic shifts influenced by technology) show the power and pitfalls of a tech-driven world. Meanwhile, terms like “romantasy” and “lore” reflect how storytelling and creativity thrive in our digital spaces, blending genres and preserving traditions. Further, words like “demure” gained prominence through viral social media posts.

The selection of these words sparks questions about how technology shapes not only our language but also our daily lives. Are we losing something valuable in the process, or are we evolving into something new?

Write a paragraph or more reflecting on the following:
- What does the term “brain rot” mean to you? Do you feel like digital media has had a positive or negative impact on your mental well-being this year?
- How do runner-up words like “slop” and “lore” connect to your experience with technology in 2024?
- In your opinion, is it possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding “brain rot”? If so, how?

Please be very “demure” and very mindful in your response. You can learn more about the the Oxford word of the year [here](https://corp.oup.com/word-of-the-year/).

The Benefits and Risks of Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries like healthcare, education, and business, but it also comes with challenges. In this journal entry, write about how AI has the potential to help improve our lives. Then, consider some ways in which AI could cause harm, especially in areas like privacy, jobs, and security. Be sure to support your thoughts with examples for both sides.

- Helpful: How does AI improve efficiency and innovation in industries like healthcare, education, or transportation?
- Harmful: What are some risks AI poses, such as job automation, bias in algorithms, or cybersecurity threats?

Write two paragraphs—one focusing on the benefits and one on the potential risks.

You can use the following resources to inform your response:

_Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process_

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.

Think about a mobile or web application that you use frequently. In a paragraph or more, describe the features of the app that make it useful or enjoyable to use.

Consider elements such as the user interface (UI), design, ease of use, functionality, performance, and any unique features that set it apart. How do these aspects work together to provide a good user experience? Be specific in your analysis, and think about how these ideas could inform your own app development projects.
