#### Option 1: The New Cell Phone Law

What are your thoughts on the new school cell phone law? How are you adjusting to it, and what challenges or benefits do you see for students and teachers?

#### Option 2: Vibe Coding with AI

“Vibe coding” means using AI tools (like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot) to help write or explain code instead of doing it fully on your own. What do you think are the risks and benefits of this AI-assisted approach for students learning computer science?

#### Option 3: Computer Science Expectations

What did you think computer science was before starting this class? Has your view changed so far? What do you hope to get from this course?
