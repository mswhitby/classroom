# September 3, 2025

Complete the following assignment in your GitHub Journal. First, please check the screen to find your name and make sure that all columns are marked "TRUE." If any column reads "FALSE," I will not be able to see your journal, and you will not receive credit for this assignment. The instructions for setting up your journal can be found at [jisd.link/journal](https://github.com/mswhitby/classroom/blob/main/_docs/resources/journal_creation.md). Please let me know if you need any assistance.

## Journal Entry


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Heading Reminder**  
> At the very top of your entry, include the date as a first-level heading in this exact format:
>
> ```markdown
> # September 2, 2025
>
> Write your entry here...
> ```

### Prompt 

Choose **ONE** of the following prompts and write a well-developed paragraph (5–7 sentences). Use C.E.R. (Claim, Evidence, Reasoning):
- Claim – your main point or stance
- Evidence – examples, experiences, or details to support your claim
- Reasoning – explain why your evidence proves your claim

#### Option 1: The New Cell Phone Law

What are your thoughts on the new school cell phone law? How are you adjusting to it, and what challenges or benefits do you see for students and teachers?

#### Option 2: Vibe Coding with AI

“Vibe coding” means using AI tools (like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot) to help write or explain code instead of doing it fully on your own. What do you think are the risks and benefits of this AI-assisted approach for students learning computer science?

#### Option 3: Computer Science Expectations

What did you think computer science was before starting this class? Has your view changed so far? What do you hope to get from this course?
