## Portfolio Project

### Objective:

Create a professional portfolio website to showcase your skills and experiences. The portfolio should include:

- **Short bio**: A brief introduction about yourself (1-2 paragraphs).
- **Resume**: A downloadable or embedded PDF of your updated resume.
- **Contact Information**: Email, phone number (optional), or a contact form.
- **Work Sample**: At least one work sample (project, code repository, design, etc.) relevant to your practicum or personal development in tech.

### Requirements:
- Recommended but not required: Use GitHub Pages for free website hosting.
- The website should be clean, easy to navigate, and responsive.
- You may use tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or website builders (e.g., Wix, WordPress, etc.).
- Ensure that the work sample is well-explained (e.g., project description, technologies used, your role).

### Steps to Complete the Project:

1. **Plan**: Outline the content and layout of your portfolio.

2. **Build**: Develop the website structure, design, and add content.

3. **Host**: Set up a GitHub Pages site (or an alternative of your choice) to host your portfolio.

4. **Review**: Get feedback from peers and your instructor.

5. **Submit**: Share the live link of your website (and GitHub repository if applicable).
