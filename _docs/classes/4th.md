# January 12, 2026

## Agenda

### 1. Journal Entry: Developing Safe Spaces Online

In the early days of online gaming, many spaces were not designed to support everyone equally. Some players—especially neurodivergent players—experienced bullying, harassment, or exclusion simply for being different.

One example is [Autcraft](https://www.autcraft.com/). Autcraft was created as a private Minecraft server specifically designed to be a **safe, moderated, and welcoming online space** for autistic children and their families. It uses clear rules, active moderation, and a strong community culture to protect players and help them feel comfortable being themselves online.

#### Prompt

**Why was Autcraft created, and what problem was it solving?**

Explain **why safe spaces are needed on the internet**, especially in online games and social platforms. Then explain **why developers have a responsibility to design and protect these spaces**, instead of leaving safety up to users alone.

In your response, consider:

- What kinds of harm can happen in unmoderated online spaces?
- How Autcraft’s design choices help protect its community
- How developers’ choices (rules, moderation tools, reporting systems) affect user experience
- What could happen if developers ignore safety and inclusion
- Do you know of any other examples of safe, inclusive online spaces?

Write 5–7 complete sentences.

### 1. Weekly Journal Prompt: Waymo Cars & School Bus Safety

In Austin, self-driving Waymo cars have been caught on video illegally driving past stopped school buses—even when the red lights were flashing and the stop arm was out. The Austin school district reported at least 19–20 violations, and the federal government (NHTSA) has opened an investigation. Waymo says a software issue contributed to the problem, but the incidents continued even after software updates.

**Write 5 to 7 sentences responding to the following:**

Why do you think a self-driving car might fail to recognize or correctly respond to a stopped school bus with its stop sign extended? What challenges might the car’s cameras, sensors, or AI face in this situation? If you were a programmer on the Waymo team, what safety improvements would you add to make sure autonomous vehicles always stop for school buses? Describe at least one fix involving sensors, software rules, or emergency-stop logic.

# November 3, 2025

## Agenda

### 1. Journal: Technology and Food Access

Over the weekend, the SNAP program (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) ran out of funding. SNAP helps millions of families buy groceries each month, so when funding runs out, many people struggle to afford healthy food.

Technology has already made a big difference in other areas—like online shopping, delivery apps, and community alerts. Could it also help people find or access food when programs like SNAP are disrupted?

For your journal entry, write 5-7 sentences answering these questions:

- **1. What’s the problem?**

    Why is it a big deal if SNAP runs out of funding? Who might be most affected?

- **2. How could technology help?**

    Think about how apps, websites, or other tech tools could connect people to local food banks, free meal programs, or grocery stores.

- **3. What challenges might exist?**

    What makes it hard for everyone to use tech-based solutions? (For example: no internet, no smartphone, privacy concerns.)

- **4. If you were the designer…**

    Imagine you were creating a tool to help solve food insecurity. What would your idea be called, and what would it do?

## Journal Entry - Prompt Engineering with Canva AI

AI tools like Canva AI can help people design lessons, games, and creative projects — but only if they are given clear and detailed instructions. This skill is called prompt engineering.

According to [CompTIA’s 2025 Workforce and Learning Trends report](https://www.comptia.org/en-us/resources/research/workforce-and-learning-trends-2025), AI skills are now a top workforce priority. And recent [industry research](https://www.yochana.com/2025-prompt-engineering-salary-landscape/) shows that prompt engineers today can earn between $63,000 and over $270,000 annually, depending on experience and role.  That means being good at writing prompts isn’t just creative — it can be financially worthwhile and useful in many tech-related jobs.

Today, you’ll act like a teacher or professional and create a Canva AI prompt that teaches something academic and includes interactive elements. You can check out my example [here](https://final-projectangel.my.canva.site/prompts).

## Part 1: Your Prompt

Choose a topic from any subject (science, math, history, English, or computer science).

Examples:
- “Create an interactive slide deck that explains the water cycle to 5th graders.”
- “Make a quiz that helps students practice variables in Python.”
- “Design a choose-your-own-path story about the Civil Rights Movement.”

Write a detailed Canva AI prompt that tells it exactly what to make. 

Include:
- What the topic is
- Who it’s for (younger students, classmates, etc.)
- What you want it to build (slide deck, quiz, story, poster, or game)
- How it should look or sound (fun, professional, colorful, etc.)

Generate your design in Canva AI, publish your site, and share the link in your journal.

### Part 2: Your Reflection

In 5–7 sentences, explain:
- What your prompt was designed to do
- How Canva AI understood or built your idea
- What parts worked well
- What parts didn’t come out as expected
- How you could improve your prompt to get a better design next time
- Why being good at prompt engineering could be valuable in future careers
