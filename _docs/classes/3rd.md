## Agenda

### Journal: "The Chromebook Challenge" - Why Safety and Ethics Matter

Recently, a dangerous trend called the “Chromebook Challenge” has been circulating online. This involves inserting objects like pencils into USB ports, which can cause fires or destroy the device. As a digital citizen and future tech professional, how should we respond to trends that put people and property at risk? What responsibilities do we have when using school technology? How would you explain the real-world consequences of this behavior to someone who thinks it’s “just a joke”?

Write two paragraphs exploring this topic, and be sure to include:
- A clear claim about whether this trend is ethical or not.
- Evidence or examples (from the letter, your experiences, or what you’ve learned in class).
- Reasoning about why safety and responsible tech use matter.

## Objective:

Students will analyze viral media trends and construct a C.E.R. argument evaluating the “100 Men vs Gorilla” challenge, considering logical reasoning and ethical implications.


## TEXS

<!-- Fundamentals of CS –  -->

§126.726(c)(4)(B): “Identify, describe, and apply principles of algorithmic thinking.” Students can reason through sequences of actions the 100 people could take, testing logic against real-world constraints.



## Agenda

### 1. Journal: Gorilla vs 100 Men

A challenge called “100 Men vs 1 Gorilla” went viral after a famous YouTuber suggested testing it. The idea: could 100 unarmed people defeat a silverback gorilla? Some people say yes with strategy; others say it’s impossible. Write two paragraphs considering the following:

1. Do you think the 100 people could win? Why or why not? Use logic, facts, and your own reasoning.

2. Do you think it’s responsible to make this kind of challenge go viral? What might people learn from it—or misunderstand?

3. What does this say about how trends spread online? Is there a connection between entertainment and education?

Use the C.E.R. structure:

- Claim – What do you believe?
- Evidence – What facts or logic back you up?
- Reasoning – Why does this matter?

## Agenda

### 1. Journal Prompt: AI & Test Prep

Write two paragraphs considering the following:

Recently, a [school in Austin, Texas used AI tutors to help students prepare for tests](https://www.fox7austin.com/news/alpha-school-two-hour-learning-ai-tutor-austin-texas)—and it worked. Their scores improved so much that they ranked in the top 2% nationally. With STAAR testing happening this week, think about how AI tools (like ChatGPT, Khanmigo, or other learning apps) could help you perform better.

How do you think AI can help you study, prepare, or stay organized for tests like the STAAR? What would be the most useful feature of an AI tutor for you personally? Be honest—do you think you’d use it? Why or why not?

Write about the following:

1. How are you feeling right now—mentally, emotionally, and physically?

2. What’s been the most stressful part of school lately?

3. What are some things you do (or could do) to take care of yourself during stressful times?

4. What’s one goal you have for the rest of the school year? How will you stay motivated to reach it?

5. Who is someone you can talk to when you’re feeling overwhelmed? Why do you trust them?

You don’t have to have all the answers—just be honest. This is your space.

### 1. Journal Prompt

Last Friday, we had a substitute teacher, and the way our class behaved made a big impact on their experience. Reflect on how the class treated the substitute—were we respectful and cooperative, or did we make their job more difficult? How do you think the substitute felt by the end of the day? If you could go back and change anything about how we acted, what would it be? Moving forward, what can you personally do to ensure that any substitute who comes into our classroom feels respected and supported? Write two paragraphs reflecting on our behavior as a class last Friday.

## Agenda

### 1. Journal Prompt

Language evolves rapidly, and slang plays a major role in how young people communicate. For teachers, counselors, social workers, and other professionals who work with youth, understanding slang can help build connections and improve communication. Consider the following:

- How can technology be used to help educators and service providers stay updated on evolving youth language?

- What are some potential benefits and challenges of integrating slang translation tools into educational apps, AI chatbots, or online resources?

- Should schools or youth organizations formally track and teach appropriate slang to improve communication, or is it best left informal?

- How might misunderstandings of slang impact interactions between adults and youth in schools, counseling, or mentoring programs?

Write two paragraphs exploring how technology could bridge generational language gaps while maintaining professionalism and cultural awareness.

## Agenda

### 1. Journal - Student's Choice

For this week's journal you may choose either the logic puzzle or the writing prompt. You **do not** have to do both!

- If you choose the logic puzzle, submit the solution to the puzzle as a [Markdown Table](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).
- If you choose the writing prompt, you response needs to be at least **TWO** paragraphs.


<details>
<summary>Writing Prompt</summary>

#### Prompt

The Super Bowl generates massive amounts of data, from player stats to real-time analytics used for coaching decisions. Many teams use **machine learning and AI** to analyze past performances and predict the best plays.

**Imagine you are a software developer working for an NFL team.** Your task is to design an application that helps coaches make better in-game decisions using real-time data. Write **TWO** paragraphs explaining your idea. If you're not sure where to start, consider the following:

1. What **features** would your application include?

2. What type of **data structures** (e.g., lists, dictionaries, databases) would you use to store player performance statistics?

3. How could **algorithms** (such as sorting, searching, or machine learning models) help analyze the data to improve decision-making?

4. If you were to visualize the data, what kind of **graphs or dashboards** would you create?

Be sure to explain your choices and how they would help a team gain a competitive advantage. You can also explore the NFL's [Next Gen Stats](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/) page to see examples how the league uses data.

## Agenda

### 1. Journal 

On January 29, a tragic mid-air collision occurred over Washington, D.C., claiming the lives of 67 people, including military personnel and young athletes returning from a competition. While we mourn this loss, tragedies like this also push us to examine what went wrong and how we can prevent similar events in the future. In aviation, technology plays a crucial role in ensuring safety—yet when systems fail, the consequences can be devastating.

Technology is a key part of modern aviation, from air traffic control systems to automated flight assistance. However, even the most advanced systems can fail. Based on the recent mid-air collision over Washington, D.C., discuss how Computer Science contributes to aviation safety. Consider software development, automation, cybersecurity, or human-computer interaction. What improvements could be made to prevent accidents like this in the future?

**Possible Connections to Computer Science**

1.  **Air Traffic Control Systems** – How do computer algorithms manage airspace and prevent collisions?
2. **Automation & AI in Aviation** – The role of autopilot systems, real-time alerts, and AI-driven decision-making.
3. **Software Errors & Bugs** – How can coding flaws or miscommunication between different software systems contribute to accidents?
4. **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** – Did poor interface design or unclear alerts play a role in the crash?
5. **Cybersecurity in Aviation** – Could hacking, jamming, or cyber vulnerabilities pose risks in air traffic management?
6. **Big Data & Predictive Analytics** – How could machine learning be used to predict and prevent accidents?

Write two (2) paragraphs exploring how technology can integration can provided for increased aviation safety. You can use one or more of the six areas listed above, or you can choose another relevant topic of your interest.

## Agenda

### 1. Journal: Apprentice Mechanic Mishaps Logic Puzzle

Four apprentice mechanics work at Rusty's Repair Shop. They are generally well-regarded by management, but last week with less supervision there were some mistakes that led to a number of angry customers. Using the clues provided, can you determine which apprentice worked on which car, and the mistake that was made?

#### Clues

1. Bart didn't work on the Sierra, nor did he leave the oil cap off.
2. The four apprentices are Kayla, the one who worked on the Honda Civic, the one who left the oil cap off, and the one who left stains on the carpet.
3. The receptionist was in tears after dealing with the customer who had found a hole was accidentally drilled in their gas tank (oops!). This wasn't the Sierra.
4. Jimmy didn't leave the oil cap off nor leave stains on the carpet of the vehicle he worked on.
5. Harrison worked on the Forester, and disliked every minute of it.

### 1. Journal: The TikTok Ban and Its Implications for Technology and Security

**Prompt:**

Recently, TikTok faced a potential nationwide ban in the United States due to national security concerns over its ownership by the Chinese company ByteDance. The situation raises important questions about the intersection of technology, privacy, and government regulation.

**Reflect on the following:**

- How do you think government intervention impacts technology companies and their users?
- In your opinion, how could companies like TikTok address security concerns while continuing to operate globally?
- Imagine you’re a developer at TikTok working on a new feature to increase user privacy. Describe one feature or policy you would implement and why.
- What lessons can you take from this situation to apply to your own projects in this course?

**Submission Instructions:**

- Write at least **TWO** paragraphs responding to the prompt using clear and complete sentences.
- Include at least one reference to how this relates to concepts we’ve covered in class, such as data privacy, app development, or software ethics.
<!-- - Post your response in your GitHub journal under today’s date as the heading: January 22, 2025. -->

## Agenda

### 1. Moneyball Movie

Moneyball is a compelling story about how data and technology revolutionized the way baseball teams approach player evaluation and team building. The movie follows Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics, as he confronts the challenge of competing against wealthier teams with a fraction of their budget. Instead of relying on traditional methods of scouting and intuition, Beane adopts a data-driven approach introduced by Peter Brand, a young economist.

The movie highlights the importance of data science, critical thinking, and problem-solving in real-world scenarios. It demonstrates how technology, algorithms, and creative use of data can disrupt industries, foster innovation, and achieve success even with limited resources. Just as Beane used analytics to make strategic decisions, students in computer science, game programming, and app development can apply similar principles of logic and data analysis to solve complex problems in various fields.

### 2. Moneyball Questions

As we watch the movie, please answer the discussion questions posted on Canvas.

### 3. Journal

- The journal entry was assigned Monday, January 13, 2025.

### Journal Entry

The Oxford Word of the Year for 2024 is “brain rot”, a term reflecting concerns about the negative effects of excessive digital consumption on mental well-being and intellectual capacity. With so much of our time spent online, it’s easy to see why this term resonates. Platforms filled with trivial content can entertain, but they might also distract us from more meaningful pursuits.

The shortlist of runner-ups adds further layers to this theme. Words like “slop” (low-quality, often AI-generated content) and “dynamic pricing” (highlighting economic shifts influenced by technology) show the power and pitfalls of a tech-driven world. Meanwhile, terms like “romantasy” and “lore” reflect how storytelling and creativity thrive in our digital spaces, blending genres and preserving traditions. Further, words like “demure” gained prominence through viral social media posts.

The selection of these words sparks questions about how technology shapes not only our language but also our daily lives. Are we losing something valuable in the process, or are we evolving into something new?

Write a paragraph or more reflecting on the following:
- What does the term “brain rot” mean to you? Do you feel like digital media has had a positive or negative impact on your mental well-being this year?
- How do runner-up words like “slop” and “lore” connect to your experience with technology in 2024?
- In your opinion, is it possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding “brain rot”? If so, how?

Please be very “demure” and very mindful in your response. You can learn more about the the Oxford word of the year [here](https://corp.oup.com/word-of-the-year/).

## Agenda

### Journal Entry

In today’s digital world, sharing and publishing content online is more common than ever. Whether you’re contributing to a project, posting on social media, or submitting work for class, it’s important to think about the kinds of information you’re sharing and how it can be used.

Reflect on the following questions:

1. Why is it important to protect your personal and sensitive information when publishing online?

2. What steps can you take to ensure that the information you share on platforms like GitHub or social media remains secure?

3. Have you ever shared something online that you later realized was too personal? How would you handle that differently now?

4. How can you balance being open and collaborative in online spaces (like working with others on coding projects) while still protecting your privacy?

Write a paragraph or more considering these questions. Include examples of actions you can take to safeguard your own data, and reflect on why being cautious online is important for your personal and professional life.

_Reflecting on Our GitHub Journal Process_

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

- **For Me:** What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
- **For You:** Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?

Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.

In your digital GitHub journal, write a paragraph explaining why following instructions exactly as they are given is important when learning how to code?

In your response, consider the following:

- How does precision affect the outcome of a program?
- What can happen if steps or details are missed in coding?
- Why is it important to develop good habits of attention to detail early in your coding journey?

Remember to use Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (C.E.R.) to structure your response.
