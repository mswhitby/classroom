## Agenda

IKEA is experimenting with a virtual store inside Roblox, where people can actually earn $16.10 per hour to do jobs like restocking shelves, serving food, and helping customers—just like in a real store. You can read more here: [IKEA is opening a new store on Roblox… and you could be paid to work there!
](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/newsroom/corporate-news/ikea-is-opening-a-new-store-on-roblox-pub8a9272d0/).

Write a journal entry (5–7 sentences) using Claim, Evidence, and Reasoning (C.E.R.) to respond to this question:

Do you think working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea or a bad idea for the future of jobs? Why?

- Claim: State your opinion clearly.
- Evidence: Use the IKEA example or your own ideas about gaming, work, or technology.
- Reasoning: Explain why your evidence supports your claim.

<!-- You may choose to complete the Beat the AI Challenge. For this option, you can use AI tools to help write your response. To receive credit, you must clearly mark at the bottom of your journal: “This response used AI.” Your challenge is to edit and improve the AI’s draft so it sounds more like you and less like a machine. -->

## Agenda

### Journal Entry

This year, the White House launched the Presidential AI Challenge. The goal is to find creative ways for students, teachers, and communities to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve real-world problems. The prize for winning teams is $10,000 per team member. You can learn more about the challenge here: [Presidential AI Challenge](https://www.ai.gov/initiatives/presidential-challenge).

Projects should:
- Use AI responsibly and ethically.
- Help people in education, health, safety, or the community.
- Be creative and realistic enough to try out.

#### Prompt

For today’s journal, write 5–7 complete sentences using the C.E.R. format:
- Claim: State your idea for an AI project.
- Evidence: Explain how your idea meets the challenge requirements.
- Reasoning: Show why your idea would be useful and how it would help people.

If you’re interested in actually submitting an idea for the challenge, you can fill out this form: [Presidential AI Challenge - Participation](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvV8FUN04EWx1Bzgj5cn3DWv-7IVqJvd6caPytAGFTNLrkew/viewform?usp=header).

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Heading Reminder**  
> At the very top of your entry, include the date as a first-level heading in this exact format:
>
> ```markdown
> # September 8, 2025
>
> Write your entry here...
> ```

### Prompt

Think of a career you’re interested in (e.g., nursing, filmmaking, fashion design, engineering, sports). Describe how computer science could be valuable in that profession. Use an example from the video or one from your own life to support your claim.

# September 2, 2025

Complete the following assignment in your GitHub Journal. First, please check the screen to find your name and make sure that all columns are marked "TRUE." If any column reads "FALSE," I will not be able to see your journal, and you will not receive credit for this assignment. The instructions for setting up your journal can be found at [jisd.link/journal](https://github.com/mswhitby/classroom/blob/main/_docs/resources/journal_creation.md). Please let me know if you need any assistance.

### Prompt 

Choose **ONE** of the following prompts and write a well-developed paragraph (5–7 sentences). Use C.E.R. (Claim, Evidence, Reasoning):
- Claim – your main point or stance
- Evidence – examples, experiences, or details to support your claim
- Reasoning – explain why your evidence proves your claim

#### Option 1: The New Cell Phone Law

What are your thoughts on the new school cell phone law? How are you adjusting to it, and what challenges or benefits do you see for students and teachers?

#### Option 2: Vibe Coding with AI

“Vibe coding” means using AI tools (like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot) to help write or explain code instead of doing it fully on your own. What do you think are the risks and benefits of this AI-assisted approach for students learning computer science?

#### Option 3: Computer Science Expectations

What did you think computer science was before starting this class? Has your view changed so far? What do you hope to get from this course?
