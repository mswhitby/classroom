# 🧮 TSI Math Tutoring — Student Handout

  

---

  

## 🎯 Objective

**I can** identify the math skill being tested and choose the correct strategy to solve TSI-style questions.

  

---

  

## ⏱️ Tutoring Agenda (60 Minutes)

  

### 1. Welcome + Test Mindset (5–10 min)

- There is **no time limit** on the TSI

- Accuracy is more important than speed

- Read the **entire question** before looking at answers

- Eliminate answers that clearly do not make sense

- Double-check **negative signs, fractions, and units**

  

---

  

### 2. Core Skills Review (30–35 min)

We will work through example problems together:

  

- Solving linear equations  

- Percent problems  

- Ratios and proportions  

- Fractions (operations and word problems)  

- Reading graphs and understanding slope  

  

**Focus:** What is the question asking?  

**Goal:** Choose the correct setup, then solve.

### 3. Independent Practice (10–15 min)

- Attempt each problem on your own

- Use scratch paper

- Ask for help if you are stuck after trying

  

---

  

### 4. Test Reminders (5 min)

- Do not rush early questions

- Skip difficult questions and return later

- Use elimination

- Trust your setup

# 📄 TSI Math Crash Sheet

*(Formulas + Reminders)*

  

---

  

## 🧠 General Reminders

- Translate words into math

- Units matter (percent, dollars, hours, feet)

- Negative signs are a common mistake

- Check if your answer makes sense

  

---

  

## 📐 Key Formulas

  

### Percent

\[

\text{Percent} = \frac{\text{part}}{\text{whole}} \times 100

\]

  

- To find a percent of a number:  

  Convert the percent to a decimal and multiply

  

---

  

### Ratios / Proportions

\[

\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}

\]

  

- Cross multiply to solve

- Keep units consistent

  

---

  

### Slope

\[

m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}

\]

  

- Positive slope: rising line  

- Negative slope: falling line

  

---

  

### Linear Equations

\[

ax + b = c

\]

  

Steps:

1. Distribute

2. Combine like terms

3. Isolate the variable

  

---

  

### Fractions

- Find a common denominator to add or subtract

- Flip the second fraction when dividing

- Convert mixed numbers if needed

  

---

  

### Graph Basics

- x-axis: horizontal

- y-axis: vertical

- Ordered pair \((x, y)\): move left/right, then up/down

How many cups of flour are needed for **9 servings**?

  

---

  

### 4. Fractions

\[

\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{2}

\]

  

---

  

### 5. Expression Evaluation

Evaluate the expression when \(x = 2\):

  

\[

5x^2 - 3x

\]

  

---

  

### 6. Slope Concept

A line rises 4 units and runs 2 units to the right.  

What is the slope?
