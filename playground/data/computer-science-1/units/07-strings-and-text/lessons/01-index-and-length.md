# Strings & Text Processing — Lesson 1: Read characters by position

**New skill:** String indexing and length  
**Previously learned:** Units 01–06

## Why this matters

Player names, QR labels, and message codes are strings. Programs often need to inspect just a few characters.

## Step 1 — Explore working Python

Read the program below. Before running it, write down the result you expect.

```python
label = 'T-BIRD'
print(len(label))
print(label[0])
print(label[-1])
```

## Step 2 — Trace the code

1. Run the example and note that the string has six characters.
2. Trace index 0 to the first character, then trace index -1 to the final character.
3. Notice that indexing reads a character but does not change the original string.

## Step 3 — Check your understanding

For the text `ROBOT`, predict `text[1]` and `len(text)` before running.

## Step 4 — Watch for this mistake

`text[len(text)]` goes one position beyond the last valid index. Use `len(text) - 1` or `-1`.

## Practice: Read characters by position

Complete `edge_letters(text)` to return the first and last characters joined into a two-character string. The input contains at least two characters.

**Function contract:** `edge_letters(text)`  
**Starter file:** [`main.py`](../../practice/01-index-and-length/main.py)

Work in the editor, using **Run** to explore and **Check** to compare against the published examples. Your submitted code, not the public check, determines the recorded score.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1 — Start</summary>

Access the first character with index 0.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2 — Build</summary>

A negative index can select the final character.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3 — Test</summary>

Join the two selected characters with `+`.

</details>

## Reflect

In 3–5 sentences, explain the algorithm you chose, one test case you predicted, and how you would detect an incorrect answer.
